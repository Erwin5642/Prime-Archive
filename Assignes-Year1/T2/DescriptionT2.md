Develop a system for withdrawing from an ATM that should release the smallest number of banknotes for an amount requested by the customer. The banknotes stored in the ATM are 500, 150, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 real.
The maximum quantities of banknotes that can fit in the ATM are: 100 (banknotes) of 500; 200 out of 150; 400 out of 50; 800 out of 20; 1,600 out of 10; 3,200 out of 5; 6,400 of 2 and 12,800 of 1 real. Initially the ATM must be stocked with the maximum quantity of banknotes. The manager can fill the ATM
whenever you want. To withdraw money, the customer must provide the withdrawal amount and their CPF. If the CPF is a valid CPF, the system will make the withdrawal and present the customer with the quantity of each banknote and the amount of the withdrawal in words. See how to determine when a CPF is valid.
For the manager, the system must inform the total amount withdrawn, the value of the existing balance and the quantity of each banknote stored in the ATM. For the total amount withdrawn, the value of the existing balance and the number of existing banknotes must be presented both in numerical value and in words.

obs: CPF is the registry of taxpayers maintained by the Federal Revenue of Brazil
