Some integers through their digits may have the capacity to praise themselves. These numbers are called Narcissists and are those equal to the sum of each of its digits raised to the power of the quantity of digits.\
For example, number 153 is a narcissist because the sum of each of its digits cubed (total digits that make up the number 153) is exactly 153.\
153 = 13 + 53 + 33 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\
Create a C program on Linux that uses library resources "myList.a" to \
1) Store narcissistic numbers between 10 and N in the structure. Must be greater than 1 million. \
2) Show the narcissistic numbers stored in the structure. \
3) Allow to exclude a narcissistic number from the structure. After deletion show the numbers remaining in the structure. \
